# Thesis project
These scripts were written for my thesis/final project (Data visualization using Unity Game Engine) during master's course.
In this project numerical data is being used to plot graphs (Individual work)
The application make uses of .csv files to load numerical data which can be visualized using standard bar graph and also can be interacted with using a free movable camera. The script "VisualizeData.cs" contains the code for visualization and interaction.
